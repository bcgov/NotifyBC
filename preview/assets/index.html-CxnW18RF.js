It aims to implement some common backend processes of a notification service without imposing any constraints on the UI frontend, nor impeding other server components&#39; functionality. This is achieved by interacting with user browser and other server components through RESTful API and other standard protocols in a loosely coupled way.</p><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#features"><span>Features</span></a></h2><p><em>NotifyBC</em> facilitates both anonymous and authentication-enabled secure webapps implementing notification feature. A <em>NotifyBC</em> server instance supports multiple notification services. A service is a topic of interest that user wants to receive updates. It is used as the partition of notification messages and user subscriptions. A user may subscribe to a service in multiple push delivery channels allowed. A user may subscribe to multiple services. In-app pull notification doesn&#39;t require subscription as it&#39;s not intrusive to user.</p><h3 id="notification" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#notification"><span>notification</span></a></h3><ul><li>both in-app pull notifications (a.k.a. messages or alerts) and push notifications</li><li>multiple push notifications delivery channels <ul><li>email</li><li>sms</li></ul></li><li>unicast and broadcast message types</li><li>future-dated notifications</li><li>for in-app pull notifications <ul><li>support read and deleted message states</li><li>message expiration</li><li>deleted messages are not deleted immediately for auditing and recovery purposes</li></ul></li><li>for broadcast push notifications <ul><li>allow both sync and async <em>POST</em> API calls.

Tokens are replaced based on the context of notification or subscription when dispatching the message. To avoid treating a string between curly braces as a token, escape the curly braces with backslash <em>\\</em>. For example <em>\\{i_am_not_a_token\\}</em> is not a token. It will be rendered as <em>{i_am_not_a_token}</em>.</p><p>Tokens whose names are predetermined by <em>NotifyBC</em> are called static tokens; otherwise they are called dynamic tokens.</p><h4 id="static-tokens" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#static-tokens"><span>static tokens</span></a></h4><p><em>NotifyBC</em> recognizes following case-insensitive static tokens.
