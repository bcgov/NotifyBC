It aims to implement some common backend processes of a notification service without imposing any constraints on the UI frontend, nor impeding other server components&#39; functionality. This is achieved by interacting with user browser and other server components through RESTful API and other standard protocols in a loosely coupled way.</p><h2 id="features" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Features</h2><p><em>NotifyBC</em> facilitates both anonymous and authentication-enabled secure webapps implementing notification feature. A <em>NotifyBC</em> server instance supports multiple notification services. A service is a topic of interest that user wants to receive updates. It is used as the partition of notification messages and user subscriptions. A user may subscribe to a service in multiple push delivery channels allowed. A user may subscribe to multiple services. In-app pull notification doesn&#39;t require subscription as it&#39;s not intrusive to user.</p><h3 id="notification" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#notification" aria-hidden="true">#</a> notification</h3><ul><li>both in-app pull notifications (a.k.a. messages or alerts) and push notifications</li><li>multiple push notifications delivery channels <ul><li>email</li><li>sms</li></ul></li><li>unicast and broadcast message types</li><li>future-dated notifications</li><li>for in-app pull notifications <ul><li>support read and deleted message states</li><li>message expiration</li><li>deleted messages are not deleted immediately for auditing and recovery purposes</li></ul></li><li>for broadcast push notifications <ul><li>allow both sync and async <em>POST</em> API calls.

Tokens are replaced based on the context of notification or subscription when dispatching the message. To avoid treating a string between curly braces as a token, escape the curly braces with backslash <em>\\</em>. For example <em>\\{i_am_not_a_token\\}</em> is not a token. It will be rendered as <em>{i_am_not_a_token}</em>.</p><p>Tokens whose names are predetermined by <em>NotifyBC</em> are called static tokens; otherwise they are called dynamic tokens.</p><h4 id="static-tokens" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#static-tokens" aria-hidden="true">#</a> static tokens</h4><p><em>NotifyBC</em> recognizes following case-insensitive static tokens.

In the remaining docs, when no further distinction is necessary, an admin request refers to both super-admin and admin request; a user request refers to both authenticated and anonymous request.</p><p>An admin request carries full authorization whereas user request has limited access. For example, a user request is not allowed to</p><ul><li>send notification</li><li>bypass the delivery channel confirmation process when subscribing to a service</li><li>retrieve push notifications through API (can only receive notification from push notification channel such as email)</li><li>retrieve in-app notifications that is not targeted to the current user</li></ul><p>The result of an API call to the same end point may differ depending on the request type. For example, the call <em>GET /notifications</em> without a filter will return all notifications to all users for an admin request, but only non-deleted, non-expired in-app notifications for authenticated user request, and forbidden for anonymous user request. Sometimes it is desirable for a request from admin ip list, which would normally be admin request, to be voluntarily downgraded to user request in order to take advantage of predefined filters such as the ones described above. This can be achieved by adding one of the HTTP headers listed above to the request. This is also why admin request is not determined by ip or token alone.</p>",4),x=e("em",null,"NotifyBC",-1),q=["src"],C=s('<h3 id="authentication-strategies" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#authentication-strategies" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Authentication Strategies</h3><p>API requests to <em>NotifyBC</em> can be either anonymous or authenticated.
