# Subscription

The subscription API encapsulates the backend workflow of user subscription and un-subscription of push notification service. Depending on whether a API call comes from user browser as a user request or from an authorized server as an admin request, _NotifyBC_ applies different validation rules. For user requests, the notification channel entered by user is unconfirmed. A confirmation code will be associated with this request. The confirmation code can be created in one of two ways:

- by _NotifyBC_ based on channel dependent _subscription.confirmationRequest.\<channel\>.confirmationCodeRegex_ [config](../config-subscription/#confirmation-request-message).
- by a trusted third party. This trusted third party encrypts the confirmation code using the public RSA key of the _NotifyBC_ instance (see more about [RSA Key Config](../config-rsaKeys/)) and pass the encrypted confirmation code to _NotifyBC_ via user browser in the same subscription request. _NotifyBC_ then decrypts to obtain the confirmation code. This method allows user subscribe to multiple notification services provided by _NotifyBC_ instances in different trust domains (i.e. service providers) and only have to confirm the subscription channel once during one browser session. In such case only one _NotifyBC_ instance should be chosen to deliver confirmation request to user.

Equipped with the confirmation code and a message template, _NotifyBC_ can now send out confirmation request to unconfirmed subscription channel. At a minimum this confirmation request should contain the confirmation code. When user receives the message, he/she echos the confirmation code back to a _NotifyBC_ provided API to verify against saved record. If match, the state of the subscription request is changed to confirmed.

For admin requests, _NotifyBC_ can still perform the above confirmation process. But admin request has full CRUD privilege, including set the subscription state to confirmed, bypassing the confirmation process.

The workflow of user subscribing to notification services offered by a single service provider is illustrated by sequence diagram below. In this case, the confirmation code is generated by _NotifyBC_.
![single service provider subscription](/img/subscription-single-service-provider.png)

In the case user subscribing to notifications offered by different service providers in separate trust domains, the confirmation code is generated by a third-party server app trusted by all _NotifyBC_ instances. Following sequence diagram shows the workflow. The diagram indicates _NotifyBC API Server 2_ is chosen to send confirmation request.

## Get Subscriptions

```
GET /subscriptions
```

- permissions required, one of
  - super admin
  - admin
  - authenticated user
- inputs
  - a filter defining fields, where, include, order, offset, and limit. See [Loopback Querying Data](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Querying-data.html) for valid syntax and examples
    - parameter name: filter
    - required: false
    - parameter type: query
    - data type: object
- outcome
  - for admin requests, returns unabridged array of subscription data matching the filter
  - for authenticated user requests, in addition to filter, following constraints are imposed on the returned array
    - only non-deleted subscriptions
    - only subscriptions created by the user
    - the _confirmationRequest_ field is removed.
  - forbidden for anonymous user requests

## Get Subscription Count

```
GET /subscriptions/count?where[property]=value
```

- permissions required, one of
  - super admin
  - admin
  - authenticated user
- inputs
  - a [where filter](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Where-filter.html)
    - parameter name: where
    - required: false
    - parameter type: query
    - data type: object
- outcome

  Validations rules are the same as _GET /subscriptions_. If passed, the output is a count of subscriptions matching the query

  ```json
  {
    "count": <number>
  }
  ```

- examples

  See LoopBack [Get instance count](http://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/PersistedModel-REST-API.html#get-instance-count) for examples.

## Create a Subscription

```
POST /subscriptions
```

- inputs
  - an object containing subscription data model fields. At a minimum all required fields that don't have a default value must be supplied. Id field should be omitted since it's auto-generated.
    - parameter name: data
    - required: true
    - parameter type: body
    - data type: object
- outcome

  _NotifyBC_ performs following actions in sequence

  1. inputs are validated. If validation fails, error is returned.
  2. for user requests, the _state_ field is forced to _unconfirmed_
  3. for authenticated user request, _userId_ field is populated with authenticated userId
  4. otherwise, _unsubscriptionCode_ is generated if config _subscription.anonymousUnsubscription.code.required_ is _true_, unless if the request is made by admin and the field is already populated
  5. if _confirmationRequest.confirmationCodeEncrypted_ is populated, a confirmation code is generated by decrypting this field using private RSA key, then put decrypted confirmation code to field _confirmationRequest.confirmationCode_
  6. otherwise, for user requests and for admin requests missing message template, the message template is set to configured value. Then, if _confirmationRequest.confirmationCodeRegex_ is populated, a confirmation code is generated conforming to regex and put to field _confirmationRequest.confirmationCode_
  7. the subscription request is saved to database.
  8. if _confirmationRequest.sendRequest_ is true, then a message is sent to _userChannelId_. The message template is determined by

     1. if _detectDuplicatedSubscription_ is true and there is already a confirmed subscription to the same _serviceName_, _channel_ and _userChannelId_, then message is sent using _duplicatedSubscriptionNotification_ as template;
     2. otherwise, a confirmation request is sent to using the template fields in _confirmationRequest_.

     [Mail merge](../overview/#mail-merge) is performed on the template regardless.

  9. The subscription data, including auto-generated id, is returned as response unless there is error when sending confirmation request or saving to database. For user request, some fields containing sensitive information such as _confirmationRequest_ are removed prior to sending the response.

- examples

  1. To subscribe a user to service _education_, copy and paste following json object to the data value box in API explorer, change email addresses as needed, and click _Try it out!_ button:

  ```
  {
    "serviceName": "education",
    "channel": "email",
    "userChannelId": "foo@bar.com"
  }
  ```

  As a result, _foo@bar.com_ should receive an email confirmation request, and following json object is returned to caller upon sending the email successfully for admin request:

  ```json
  {
    "serviceName": "education",
    "channel": "email",
    "userChannelId": "foo@bar.com",
    "state": "unconfirmed",
    "confirmationRequest": {
      "confirmationCodeRegex": "\\d{5}",
      "sendRequest": true,
      "from": "no_reply@bar.com",
      "subject": "confirmation",
      "textBody": "Enter {confirmation_code} on screen",
      "confirmationCode": "45304"
    },
    "created": "2016-10-03T17:35:40.202Z",
    "updated": "2016-10-03T17:35:40.202Z",
    "id": "57f296ec7eead50554c61de7"
  }
  ```

  For non-admin request, the field _confirmationRequest_ is removed from response, and field _userId_ is populated if request is authenticated:

  ```json
  {
    "serviceName": "education",
    "channel": "email",
    "userChannelId": "foo@bar.com",
    "state": "unconfirmed",
    "userId": "<user_id>",
    "created": "2016-10-03T18:17:09.778Z",
    "updated": "2016-10-03T18:17:09.778Z",
    "id": "57f2a0a5b1aa0e2d5009eced"
  }
  ```

  2. To subscribe a user to service _education_ with RSA public key encrypted confirmation code supplied, POST following request

     ```json
     {
       "serviceName": "education",
       "channel": "email",
       "userChannelId": "foo@bar.com",
       "confirmationRequest": {
         "confirmationCodeEncrypted": "<encrypted-confirmation-code>",
         "sendRequest": true,
         "from": "no_reply@bar.com",
         "subject": "confirmation",
         "textBody": "Enter {confirmation_code} on screen"
       }
     }
     ```

     As a result, _NotifyBC_ will decrypt the confirmation code using the private RSA key, replace placeholder _{confirmation_code}_ in the email template with the confirmation code, and send confirmation request to _foo@bar.com_.

## Verify a Confirmation Code

```
GET /subscriptions/{id}/verify
```

- inputs
  - subscription id
    - parameter name: id
    - required: true
    - parameter type: path
    - data type: string
  - confirmation code
    - parameter name: confirmationCode
    - required: true
    - parameter type: query
    - data type: string
  - whether or not replacing existing subscriptions
    - parameter name: replace
    - required: false
    - parameter type: query
    - data type: boolean
- outcome

  _NotifyBC_ performs following actions in sequence

  1. the subscription identified by _id_ is retrieved
  2. for user request, the _userId_ of the subscription is checked against current request user, if not match, error is returned; otherwise
  3. input parameter _confirmationCode_ is checked against _confirmationRequest.confirmationCode_. If not match, error is returned; otherwise
  4. if input parameter _replace_ is supplied and set to _true_, then existing confirmed subscriptions from the same _serviceName_, _channel_ and _userChannelId_ are deleted. No unsubscription acknowledgement notification is sent
  5. _state_ is set to _confirmed_
  6. the subscription is saved back to database
  7. displays acknowledgement message according to [configuration](../config-subscription#confirmation-verification-acknowledgement-messages)

## Update a Subscription

```
PATCH /subscriptions/{id}
```

This API is used by authenticated user to change user channel id (such as email address) and resend confirmation code.

- permissions required, one of
  - super admin
  - admin
  - authenticated user
- inputs

  - subscription id
    - parameter name: id

    - data type: string
  - an object containing fields to be updated.
    - parameter name: data
    - required: true
    - parameter type: body
    - data type: object

- outcome

  _NotifyBC_ processes the request similarly as creating a subscription except during input validation it imposes following extra constraints to user request

  - only fields _userChannelId_, _state_ and _confirmationRequest_ can be updated
  - when changing _userChannelId_, _confirmationRequest_ must also be supplied
  - if _userChannelId_ is different from the saved record, _state_ is forced to _unconfirmed_.

## Delete a Subscription (unsubscribing)

```
DELETE /subscriptions/{id}?unsubscriptionCode={unsubscriptionCode}&additionalServices[]={additionalServices}&userChannelId={userChannelId}
or
GET /subscriptions/{id}/unsubscribe?unsubscriptionCode={unsubscriptionCode}&additionalServices[]={additionalServices}&userChannelId={userChannelId}
```

- inputs
  - subscription id
    - parameter name: id
    - required: true
    - parameter type: path
    - data type: string
  - unsubscription code for anonymous request
    - parameter name: unsubscriptionCode
    - required: false
    - parameter type: query
    - data type: string
  - additional service names to unsubscribe
    - parameter name: additionalServices
    - required: false
    - parameter type: query
    - data type: array of strings. If there is only one item and its value is _\_all_, then all services
      the user subscribed on this _NotifyBC_ instance are included. Supply multiple items by repeating this query parameter.
  - user channel id for extended validation
    - parameter name: userChannelId
    - required: false
    - parameter type: query
    - data type: string
- outcome

  _NotifyBC_ performs following actions in sequence

  1. the subscription identified by _id_ is retrieved
  2. for user request,

  - if request is authenticated, the _userId_ of the subscription is checked against current request user, if not match, request is rejected
  - if request is anonymous, and server is configured to require unsubscription code, the input unsubscription code is matched against the _unsubscriptionCode_ field. Request is rejected if not match. In addition, if input parameter _userChannelId_ is populated but doesn't match, request is rejected

  3. if the subscription state is not _confirmed_, request is rejected
  4. if _additionalServices_ is populated, database is queried to retrieve the _serviceName_ and _id_ fields of the additional subscriptions
  5. the field _state_ is set to _deleted_ for the subscription identified by _id_ as well as additional subscriptions retrieved in previous step
  6. if _additionalServices_ is not empty, the service names and ids of the additional subscriptions are added to field _unsubscribedAdditionalServices_ of the subscription identified by _id_ to allow bulk undo unsubscription later on
  7. for anonymous unsubscription, an acknowledgement notification is sent to user if configured so
  8. returns

  - for anonymous request, either the message or redirect as configured in _anonymousUnsubscription.acknowledgements.onScreen_
  - for authenticated user or admin requests, number of records affected or error message if occurred.

- <a name="unsubscription-example"></a> examples
  1. To allow an anonymous subscriber to unsubscribe single subscription, provide url token _{unsubscription_url}_ in notification messages. When sending notification, [mail merge](../overview/#mail-merge) is performed on the token resolving to the GET API url and parameters.
  2. To allow an anonymous subscriber to unsubscribe all subscriptions, provide url token _{unsubscription_all_url}_ in notification messages.

## Un-deleting a Subscription

```
GET /subscriptions/{id}/unsubscribe/undo
```

This API allows an anonymous subscriber to undo an unsubscription.

- inputs
  - subscription id
    - parameter name: id
    - required: true
    - parameter type: path
    - data type: string
  - unsubscription code
    - parameter name: unsubscriptionCode
    - required: false
    - parameter type: query
    - data type: string
- outcome

  _NotifyBC_ performs following actions in sequence

  1. the subscription identified by _id_ is retrieved
  2. for user request,

  - if request is anonymous, and server is configured to require unsubscription code, the input unsubscription code is matched against the _unsubscriptionCode_ field. Request is rejected if not match
  - if request is authenticated, request is rejected
  - if the subscription state is not _deleted_, request is rejected

  3. the field _state_ is set to _confirmed_ for the subscription identified by _id_ as well as additional subscriptions identified in field _unsubscribedAdditionalServices_, if populated
  4. field _unsubscribedAdditionalServices_ is removed if populated
  5. returns either the message or redirect as configured in _[anonymousUndoUnsubscription](../config-subscription/#anonymousUndoUnsubscription)_

- example

  To allow an anonymous subscriber to undo unsubscription, provide link token _{unsubscription_reversion_url}_ in unsubscription acknowledgement notification, which is by default set. When sending notification, [mail merge](../overview/#mail-merge) is performed on this token resolving to the API url and parameters.
