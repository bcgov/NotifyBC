# Notification

The notification API encapsulates the backend workflow of staging and dispatching a message to targeted user after receiving the message from event source.

Depending on whether an API call comes from user browser as a user request or from an authorized server application as an admin request, _NotifyBC_ applies different permissions. Admin request allows full CRUD operations. An authenticated user request, on the other hand, are only allowed to get a list of in-app pull notifications targeted to the current user and changing the state of the notifications. An unauthenticated user request can not access any API.

When a notification is created by the event source server application, the message is saved to database prior to responding to API caller. In addition, for push notification, the message is delivered immediately, i.e. the API call is synchronous. For in-app pull notification, the message, which by default is in state _new_, can be retrieved later on by browser user request. A user request can only get the list of in-app messages targeted to the current user. A user request can then change the message state to _read_ or _deleted_ depending on user action. A deleted message cannot be retrieved subsequently by user requests, but the state can be updated given the correct _id_.
::: warning <i>Deleted</i> message is still kept in database.
<i>NotifyBC</i> provides API for deleting a notification. For the purpose of auditing and recovery, this API only marks the <i>state</i> field as deleted rather than deleting the record from database.
:::
::: tip undo in-app notification deletion within a session
Because "deleted" message is still kept in database, you can implement undo feature for in-app notification as long as the message id is retained prior to deletion within the current session. To undo, call <a href="#update-a-notification">update</a> API to set desired state.
:::

In-app pull notification also supports message expiration by setting a date in field _validTill_. An expired message cannot be retrieved by user requests.

A message, regardless of push or pull, can be unicast or broadcast. A unicast message is intended for an individual user whereas a broadcast message is intended for all confirmed subscribers of a service. A unicast message must have field _userChannelId_ populated. The value of _userChannelId_ is channel dependent. In the case of email for example, this would be user's email address. A broadcast message must set _isBroadcast_ to true and leave _userChannelId_ empty.

::: warning Why field <i>isBroadcast</i>?
Unicast and broadcast message can be distinguished by whether field <i>userChannelId</i> is empty or not alone. So why the extra field <i>isBroadcast</i>? This is in order to prevent inadvertent marking a unicast message broadcast by omitting <i>userChannelId</i> or populating it with empty value. The precaution is necessary because in-app notifications may contain personalized and confidential information.
:::
_NotifyBC_ ensures the state of an in-app broadcast message is isolated by user, so that for example, a message read by one user is still new to another user. To achieve this, _NotifyBC_ maintains two internal fields of array type - _readBy_ and _deletedBy_. When a user request updates the _state_ field of an in-app broadcast message to _read_ or _deleted_, instead of altering the _state_ field, _NotifyBC_ appends the current user to _readBy_ or _deletedBy_ list. When user request retrieving in-app messages, the _state_ field of the broadcast message in HTTP response is updated based on whether the user exists in field _deletedBy_ and _readBy_. If existing in both fields, _deletedBy_ takes precedence (the message therefore is not returned). The record in database, meanwhile, is unchanged. Neither field _deletedBy_ nor _readBy_ is visible to user request.

## Model Schema

The API operates on following notification data model fields:

The state for the user is tracked in fields <i>readBy</i> and <i>deletedBy</i> in such case. For user request, the value contains correct state.</p>

## Get Notifications

```
GET /notifications
```

- permissions required, one of
  - super admin
  - admin
  - authenticated user
- inputs
  - a filter defining fields, where, include, order, offset, and limit. See [Loopback Querying Data](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Querying-data.html#filters) for valid syntax and examples
    - parameter name: filter
    - required: false
    - parameter type: query
    - data type: object
- outcome
  - for admin requests, returns unabridged array of notification data matching the filter
  - for authenticated user requests, in addition to filter, following constraints are imposed on the returned array
    - only inApp notifications
    - only non-deleted notifications. For broadcast notification, non-deleted means not marked by current user as deleted
    - only non-expired notifications
    - for unicast notifications, only the ones targeted to current user
    - if current user is in _readBy_, then the _state_ is changed to _read_
    - the internal field _readBy_ and _deletedBy_ are removed
  - forbidden to anonymous user requests

## Get Notification Count

```
GET /notifications/count
```

- permissions required, one of
  - super admin
  - admin
  - authenticated user
- inputs
  - a [where filter](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Where-filter.html)
    - parameter name: filter
    - required: false
    - parameter type: query
    - data type: object
- outcome

  Validations rules are the same as _GET /notifications_. If passed, the output is a count of notifications matching the query

  ```json
  {
    "count": <number>
  }
  ```

## Create/Send Notifications

```
POST /notifications
```

- permissions required, one of
  - super admin
  - admin
- inputs
  - an object containing notification data model fields. At a minimum all required fields that don't have a default value must be supplied. Id field should be omitted since it's auto-generated. The API explorer only created an empty object for field _message_ but you should populate the child fields according to [model schema](#model-schema)
    - parameter name: data
    - required: true
    - parameter type: body
    - data type: object
- outcome

  _NotifyBC_ performs following actions in sequence

  1. if it's a user request, error is returned
  2. inputs are validated. If validation fails, error is returned. In particular, for unicast push notification, the recipient as identified by either _userChannelId_ or _userId_ must have a confirmed subscription if field _skipSubscriptionConfirmationCheck_ is not set to true. If _skipSubscriptionConfirmationCheck_ is set to true, then the subscription check is skipped, but in such case the request must contain _userChannelId_, not _userId_ as subscription data is not queried to obtain _userChannelId_ from _userId_.
  3. for push notification, if field _httpHost_ is empty, it is populated based on request's http protocol and host.
  4. the notification request is saved to database
  5. if the notification is future-dated, then all subsequent request processing is skipped and response is sent back to user. Steps 7-11 below will be carried out later on by the cron job when the notification becomes current.
  6. if it's an async broadcast push notification, then response is sent back to user but steps 7-12 below is processed separately
  7. for unicast push notification, the message is dispatched to targeted user; for broadcast push notification, following actions are performed:

     1. number of confirmed subscriptions is retrieved
     2. the subscriptions are partitioned and processed concurrently as described in config section [Broadcast Push Notification Task Concurrency](../config-notification/#broadcast-push-notification-task-concurrency)
     3. when processing an individual subscription,

        1. if the subscription has filter rule defined in field _broadcastPushNotificationFilter_ and notification contains field _data_, then the data is matched against the filter rule. Notification message is only dispatched if there is a match.
        2. if the notification has filter rule defined in field _broadcastPushNotificationSubscriptionFilter_ and subscription contains field _data_, then the data is matched against the filter rule. Notification message is only dispatched if there is a match.

        If the subscription failed to pass any of the two filters, and if both _guaranteedBroadcastPushDispatchProcessing_ and _logSkippedBroadcastPushDispatches_ are true, the subscription id is logged to _dispatch.skipped_

     Regardless of unicast or broadcast, mail merge is performed on messages before dispatching.

  8. the state of push notification is updated to _sent_ or _error_ depending on sending status. For broadcast push notification, the dispatching could be failed only for a subset of users. In such case, the field _dispatch.failed_ contains a list of objects of {userChannelId, subscriptionId, error} the message failed to deliver to, but the state will still be set to _sent_.
  9. For broadcast push notifications, if _guaranteedBroadcastPushDispatchProcessing_ is _true_, then field _dispatch.successful_ is populated with a list of _subscriptionId_ of the successful dispatches.
  10. For push notifications, the bounce records of successful dispatches are updated
  11. the updated notification is saved back to database
  12. if it's an async broadcast push notification with a callback url, then the url is called with POST verb containing the notification with updated status as the request body
  13. for synchronous notification, the saved record is returned unless there is an error saving to database, in which case error is returned

- example

  To send a unicast email push notification, copy and paste following json object to the data value box in API explorer, change email addresses as needed, and click _Try it out!_ button:

  ```json
  {
    "serviceName": "education",
    "userChannelId": "foo@bar.com",
    "skipSubscriptionConfirmationCheck": true,
    "message": {
      "from": "no_reply@bar.com",
      "subject": "test",
      "textBody": "This is a test"
    },
    "channel": "email"
  }
  ```

  As the result, _foo@bar.com_ should receive an email notification even if the user is not a confirmed subscriber, and following json object is returned to caller upon sending the email successfully:

  ```json
  {
    "serviceName": "education",
    "state": "sent",
    "userChannelId": "foo@bar.com",
    "skipSubscriptionConfirmationCheck": true,
    "message": {
      "from": "no_reply@bar.com",
      "subject": "test",
      "textBody": "This is a test"
    },
    "created": "2016-09-30T20:37:06.011Z",
    "updated": "2016-09-30T20:37:06.011Z",
    "channel": "email",
    "isBroadcast": false,
    "id": "57eeccf23427b61a4820775e"
  }
  ```

## Update a Notification

```
PATCH /notifications/{id}
```

This API is mainly used for updating an inApp notification.

- permissions required, one of
  - super admin
  - admin
  - authenticated user
- inputs

  - notification id
    - parameter name: id
    - required: true
    - parameter type: path
    - data type: string
  - an object containing fields to be updated.
    - parameter name: data
    - required: true
    - parameter type: body
    - data type: object

- outcome
  - for user requests, _NotifyBC_ performs following actions in sequence
    1. for unicast notification, if the notification is not targeted to current user, error is returned
    2. all fields except for _state_ are discarded from the input
    3. for broadcast notification, current user id in appended to array _readBy_ or _deletedBy_, depending on whether _state_ is _read_ or _deleted_, unless the user id is already in the array. The _state_ field itself is then discarded
    4. the notification identified by _id_ is merged with the updates and saved to database
    5. HTTP response code 204 is returned, unless there is error.
  - admin requests are allowed to update any field

## Delete a Notification

This API is mainly used for marking an inApp notification deleted. It has the same effect as updating a notification with state set to _deleted_.

```
DELETE /notifications/{id}
```

- permissions required, one of
  - super admin
  - admin
  - authenticated user
- inputs
  - notification id
    - parameter name: id
    - required: true
    - parameter type: path
    - data type: string
- outcome: same as the outcome of [Update a Notification](#update-a-notification) with _state_ set to _deleted_.

## Replace a Notification

```
PUT /notifications/{id}
```

This API is intended to be only used by admin web console to modify a notification in _new_ state. Notifications in such state are typically future-dated or of channel _in-app_.

- permissions required, one of
  - super admin
  - admin
- inputs
  - notification id
    - parameter name: id
    - required: true
    - parameter type: path
