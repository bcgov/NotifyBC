# What's New

::: tip Why v2?
_NotifyBC_ has been built on Node.js [LoopBack](https://loopback.io/) framework since 2017. LoopBack v4, which was released in 2019, is backward incompatible. To keep software stack up-to-date, unless rewriting from scratch, it is necessary to port _NotifyBC_ to LoopBack v4. Great care has been taken to minimize migration effort.
