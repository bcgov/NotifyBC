# Quick Start

For the impatient, here's how to get a boilerplate _NotifyBC_ instance up and running if you have git and node.js installed:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bcgov/NotifyBC.git
cd NotifyBC
npm i -g yarn && yarn install && yarn build
yarn start
# => Now browse to http://localhost:3000
```

If you're running into problems, check out full [installation](../installation/) guide.
